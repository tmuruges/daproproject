This is a submission for Coursera: Developing Data Products- Course Project

Storm Data Explorer
==================

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Dataset has been obtained from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and processed for the course project. This is the same file we used for the Cousera's Reproduciable Research Course.

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/tmuruges/daproproject).

The presentation for the project can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/murugesan67/171508)
